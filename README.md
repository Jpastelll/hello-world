# hello-world
The start of something... i guess?
Sol here, i am a Brazilian teenager almost becoming a young adult by now, started programing not for 2 months even. I like watching series and movies and playing games, also like coding, always saw videos of people programing stuff and found it amazing. Really hopping to get good at it.
